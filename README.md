## XRP Symbol

In order for XRP to be perceived as a currency, it needs its own symbol. This repository intends to allow collaboration to create the ubiquitious XRP Leger symbol that we can use to display the amount of XRP.

Please open a pull request or submit issues with suggestions.

### Current Suggested Symbol

This symbol contains the letters X, R and P hidden within it, and it also displays the shape of a "drop" or "droplet". A drop is the smallest XRP denomination (1 XRP = 1,000,000). This droplet was positioned in equilibrium perpendicular to the "top left to bottom right" line on the X.
