## XRP Symbol

In order for XRP to be perceived as a currency, it needs its own symbol. This repository intends to allow collaboration to create the ubiquitious XRP Ledger symbol that we can use to display the amount of XRP.

Please open a pull request or submit tickets with suggestions.

### Suggested Symbol

The following symbol contains the letters X, R and P hidden within the shape. The symbol also displays the shape of a "drop" or "droplet". A drop is the smallest XRP denomination (1 XRP = 1,000,000 drops). The droplet was positioned in equilibrium, perpendicular to the "top left to bottom right" line on the X.
